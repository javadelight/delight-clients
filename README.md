# delight-clients

A good way to start developing any client application in Java. 

Also see the sister project [Java Server API](https://github.com/mxro/server-api).

**Why** After long trail and error we found a small yet powerful set of core utilities 
which seem to work well for most client applications in Java. This project is designed to share
this set and help make a few decisions right at the beginning.

## Usage

### Instantiating Clients

One application can have one or more clients. These clients embed within them common features useful for application development.

A client can be created as follows:

```java
Client client = Clients.create();
```

### Metrics

Metrics such as counters and throughput are natively supported by this API.

Values for a metric can be stored as follows:

```java
client.metrics().record(Metrics.value("stat1", 100));
client.metrics().record(Metrics.value("stat1", 200));
client.metrics().record(Metrics.value("stat1", 300));

String metric = client.metrics().retrieve("stat1").render().get();
```

Metrics are based on the [Lightweight Java Metrics](https://github.com/mxro/lightweight-java-metrics) project.

### Promises

The Client API supports the easy creation of promises:

```java
Promise<String> promise = client.promise(new Operation<String>() {
    public void apply(ValueCallback<ResultType> callback) {
       callback.onSuccess("Hello");
    }
});

System.out.println("Got: "+promise.get());
```

More information on promises can be found in the [Java Promise](https://github.com/mxro/java-promise) project.

### Finalizing Clients

Clients need to be finalized since they might perform some work in dedicated threads to minimize the performance impact on the main 
application.

```java
client.stop().get();
```

## Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.mxro.client</groupId>
	<artifactId>client-api</artifactId>
	<version>[latest version]</version>
</dependency>
```
